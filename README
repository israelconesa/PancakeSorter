Dear Priyesh,

This is a partial solution for the pancake sorting problem. It reads pancakes sizes in order
from file but the file is hardcoded.

Currently, it only accounts for pancakes which have NO burn sides, i.e. negative sizes.

There is a solution on a separate branch for those pancakes that have burnt sides
