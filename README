Dear Priyesh,

This is my solution to the pancake flipping paradigm :)

Unlike the master branch, it deals with burn pancakes (negative numbers). I worked with
the requirement that ONLY the burnt pancakes at the beginning had to be dealt with, i.e.
force them to have the burnt side down.

It reads pancakes sizes in order from file but the file itself is hardcoded. I don't have
any energy left to put it as a system property.

The file has some scenarios that I found useful for testing.

I'd love to have your feedback. I know it could do with a bit of refactoring but, again,
no energy left. :)
